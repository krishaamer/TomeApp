  	<h2>About Kris Haamer</h2>
    <p>The film represents my (the director’s) personal point of view. I make no pretense of objectivity. Viewers may agree or disagree with my views. 
    	A strong director’s vision and my background play an integral role in the film.</p>
      
    <p>I combine documentary elements and interviews with a semi-fictional story arc. I craft a non-fiction story with care to give narrative structure
    	 to a documentary story. To achieve this, I use strong directorial intervention and do away with the objectivity associated with documentary film.
